    <h1>Preface</h1>
    <p>
        If you want to take up programming seriously, you’ve come across the right book. For real! This is the book with
        which you can make your first steps in programming. It will give a flying start to your long journey into
        learning modern programming languages and software development technologies. This book teaches the fundamental
        principles and concepts of programming, which have not changed significantly in the past 15 years.
        Do not hesitate to read this book even if C# is not the language you would like to pursue. Whatever language you
        move on to, the knowledge we will give you here will stick, because this book will teach you to think like
        programmers. We will show you and teach you how to write programs for solving practical algorithmic problems,
        form the skills in you to come up with (and implement) algorithms, and use various data structures.
        As improbable as it might seem to you, the basic principles of writing computer programs have not changed all
        that much in the past 15 years. Programming languages change, technologies get modernized, integrated
        development environments get more and more advanced but the fundamental principles of programming remain the
        same. When beginners learn to think algorithmically, and then learn to divide a problem instinctively into a
        series of steps to solve it, as well as when they learn to select the appropriate data structures and write
        high-quality programming code that is when they become programmers. Once you acquire these skills, you can
        easily learn new languages and various technologies – like Web programming, HTML5 and JavaScript, mobile
        development, databases and SQL, XML, REST, ASP.NET, Java EE, Python, Ruby and hundreds more. <br />
        About the Book <br>
        This book is designed specifically to teach you to think like a programmer and the C# language is just a tool
        that can be replaced by any other modern programming languages, such as Java, C++, PHP or Python. This is a book
        on programming, not a book on C#! <br />
        Please Excuse Us for the Bugs in the Translation! <br />
        This book was originally written in Bulgarian language by a large team of volunteer software engineers and later
        translated into English. None of the authors, translators, editors and the other contributors is a native
        English speaker so you might find many mistakes and imprecise translation. Please, excuse us! Over 70 people
        have participated in this project (mostly Bulgarians): authors, editors, translators, correctors, bug
        submitters, etc. and
        14 Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#
        still the quality could be improved. The entire team congratulates you on your choice to read this book and we
        believe the content in it is more important that the small mistakes and inaccuracies you might find. Enjoy!
        <br />
        Who Is This Book Aimed At? <br />
        This book is best suited for beginners. It is intended for anyone who so far has not engaged seriously in
        programming and would like to begin doing it. This book starts from scratch and introduces you step by step into
        the fundamentals of programming. It won’t teach you absolutely everything you might need for becoming a software
        engineer and working at a software company, but it will lay the groundwork on which you can build up
        technological knowledge and skills, and through them you will be able to turn programming into your profession.
        If you’ve never written a computer program, don’t worry. There is always a first time. In this book we will
        teach you how to program from scratch. We do not expect any previous knowledge or abilities. All you need is
        some basic computer literacy and a desire to take up programming. The rest you will learn from the book.
        If you can already write simple programs or if you have studied programming at school or in college, or you’ve
        coded with friends, do not assume you know everything! Read this book and you’ll become aware of how many things
        you’ve missed. This book is indeed for beginners, but it teaches concepts and skills that even experienced
        professional programmers lack. Software companies are riddled with a shocking amount of self-taught amateurs
        who, despite having programmed on a salary for years, have no grasp of the fundamentals of programming and have
        no idea what a hash table is, how polymorphism works and how to work with bitwise operations. Don’t be like
        them! Learn the basics of programming first and then the technologies. Otherwise you risk having your
        programming skills crippled, more or less, for years, if not for life.
        If, on the other hand, you have programming experience, examine this book in details and see if you are familiar
        with all subjects we have covered, in order to decide whether it is for you or not. Take a close look especially
        at the chapters "Data Structures and Algorithms Complexity", "Object-Oriented Programming Principles",
        "Methodology of Problem Solving" and "High-Quality Programming Code". It is very likely that, even if you have
        several years of experience, you might not be able to work well with data structures; you might not be able to
        evaluate the complexity of an algorithm; you might not have mastered in depth the concepts of object-oriented
        programming (including UML and design patterns); and you might not be acquainted with the best practices for
        writing high-quality programming code. These are very important topics that are not covered in all books on
        programming, so don’t skip them!
